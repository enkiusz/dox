# dox

git-based encrypted document repo.

## Overview

This tools is based on the excellent `pass` password manager tool. It was altered to better support use-cases common when using it as a generic document storage (think scanned dead trees or office suite docs). It has also been streamlined with some code removed, for example code dealing with generating new passwords or using the clipboard. 

Only Linux and Darwin support has been tested at this point.

Other than the above changes the structure of the document repository is identical to the structure of a password repository handled by `pass` and the program usage is also almost identical.
